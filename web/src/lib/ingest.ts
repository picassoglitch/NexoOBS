/**
 * Ingest endpoints shown in the encoder panel.
 *
 * The relay base is the address the encoder pushes to (the NexoOBS relay
 * fans out to enabled destinations). It MUST be the raw reachable RTMP
 * endpoint — for a Railway service that's the TCP-proxy host:port
 * (e.g. rtmp://acela.proxy.rlwy.net:26151/live), NOT the HTTP custom
 * domain (ingest.nexo-ai.world only carries HTTP, not RTMP on 1935).
 *
 * RTMP only: MediaMTX has SRT/WebRTC off and Railway's TCP proxy can't
 * carry UDP, so we don't advertise endpoints that wouldn't connect.
 *
 * Set NEXOOBS_RELAY_RTMP_URL to that base. The value is read server-side
 * and passed into the client, so it never hardcodes a proxy port that can
 * change.
